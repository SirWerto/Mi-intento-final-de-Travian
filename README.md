# MyTravian

MyTravian is a project which tries to fill the gap between identifying the inactive/cows/farms players by hand and doing with machine learning techniques

For achieving this goal, it needs:

    [] A collector to fetch all necesary data
    [] A database interface for storing the data
    [] A clasifier model for prediction
    [] A beautiful web interface which is going to run in the cloud (suggestions are appreciated)

### Why do i choose elixir/erlang/beam over other lenguages?

1. It fits very well the objetive of the project
2. More people should learn it
3. I like it a lot
